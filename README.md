# US-POLLUTION-DASHBOARD
This project is a comprehensive analysis of air pollution data across the United States from 2006 to 2010.
üåç U.S. Pollution Analysis Dashboard
üåü Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of air pollution data across the United States from 2006 to 2010. The dataset includes daily measurements of four major pollutants: Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). The goal of this project was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into pollution trends, state-wise pollutant levels, and the impact of these pollutants over time.

üöÄ Key Features
üìä Interactive Dashboards: Designed 5 interactive Power BI pages, each focusing on a specific pollutant and providing detailed insights.

üßπ Data Cleaning: Handled missing values by replacing nulls with 0 to ensure accurate analysis.

üìà Visualizations: Utilized a variety of visualizations such as filled maps, line charts, bar charts, tables, and cards to present data effectively.

üîç Filters and Slicers: Implemented slicers for states, cities, counties, and date ranges to enable dynamic exploration of the data.

üìÖ Quarterly Analysis: Provided a quarter-wise breakdown of pollutant levels to identify seasonal trends.

üèÜ Top Pollutant Analysis: Identified the top 10 states and cities with the highest levels of each pollutant.

üå°Ô∏è AQI Analysis: Highlighted Air Quality Index (AQI) values for each pollutant, with conditional formatting to emphasize high and low values.

üìä Dashboard Pages
